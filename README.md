# Unit testing with pytestüêçüö®

## Levels of testing
‚ú® Unit testing: testing fucntions and classes. Done by developers. Smallest unit of testing possible, module or component is tested in isolation. 

‚ú®‚ú® Component testing: testing interfacing issues between the modules. Done by testers.

‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® System testing: testing application as a whole thing. Done by testers. Made in environment similar to the production one.

‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®Acceptance testing: testing if application satisfies end-user requirements and can be deployed. Can be made by testers as well as final users (alpha and beta testing).  

## What is unit testing?
- tests individual modules independently üçé
- unit tests are the first filter for catcing bugs üêõ
- should run fast with automated execution üöÄ
- for development environment rather than the production one üî®

## What is test driven development (TDD)?
- Tests are written before the production code
- Tests and production code are written step by step
- The process is iterative: üö®red pahse, ‚úîÔ∏ègreen phase, üî®refactor phase

üö®write a failing unit test -> ‚úîÔ∏èwrite prod code to pass only this test -> üî®refactor test and code to make it clean -> üö®write a new failing unit test -> ‚úîÔ∏èwrite prod code to pass only the new test -> üî®refactor test and code to make it clean ->üö®-> ‚úîÔ∏è->üî®-> etc. until the feature is complete

## Laws of TDD
Robert Martin created the following Laws of TDD in his book ‚ÄúClean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Development‚Äù:
1. You may not write any production code until you have written a failing unit test.
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test

## `pytest`üì¶
`pytest` is a [framework for tests](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/). It uses standart python assert statement üêç
- **tests** are python functions with "test" in the beginnig of the fucntion name: `test_pipeline_step`, `test_sum`. Tests can be grouped by putting them in the same module or class.
- **test class** should have "Test"  in the beginnig of the class name: `TestClass`, `TestSimilarThings`. Test class should NOT have `__init__` method.
- **filenames** for test modules should have "test" in the beginning or end of the filename: `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.

### install `pytest`

`pip install pytest`: requires Python 3.7+
Install plugin:
`pip install pytest-cov`: coverage reporting, compatible with distributed testing

### run `pytest` with command line arguments
Run from the directory with tests: 
`python -m pytest`
for running all tests in all modules from the current working directory (pay attention to [naming](#pytest)). With command line arguments (all params [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/reference/reference.html#command-line-flags)):
- `python -m pytest -v`: verbose mode
- `python -m pytest -q`: quiet mode (when running hundreds of tests)
- `python -m pytest -s`: show print statements on the console, don't capture the console output

Command line arguments for `pytest-cov` plugin (more params [here](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html)): 
- `python -m pytest --cov-report=term`: generate coverage report in terminal
- `python -m pytest --cov-report=html`: generate coverage report as HTML

With several arguments: `python -m pytest -s -v`
